# RFSoC QCoDeS driver development

This repository is dedicated to the devolopment of a QCoDeS driver for the ADC/DAC instrument developped at Institut NÃ©el based on Xilinx RFSoC.

### Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC :

### QCoDeS Python package : 

Qcodes is a Python-based data acquisition framework for physics experiments !

## Driver :

So far the driver uses the *SequenceGenerator.py* module as well as the *driver_rfsoc.py* file. The *driver_rfsoc_test.py* is used to test the driver.
Some scripts for testing the card without using te driver can be found in the test/ADC-tests branch
